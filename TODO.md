# TODO

List of ideas yet to be implemented

## Manager class
- [ ] Add etymology interface
- [ ] Add temporary cache of in-lanaguage words that haven't been used yet
- [ ] Add interface for pulling words from the cache to add to the lexicon
- [ ] Add ability to allow/block duplicate words in both in-language and local language
- [ ] Decide whether UI belongs in this repo or if it should be its own

## Lexicon class
- [ ] Add etymology tracking
- [ ] Add option to sort search results
- [ ] Add option to filter results by multiple criteria
- [ ] Add defined parts of speech to the lexicon config
- [ ] Decide how many more concepts need to be encapsulated in a lexical entry (bound vs. free morphemes, declensions, etc.)
- [ ] Decide where gramatical rules belong. Are they part of the lexicon or some other entity?
