# conlang-tools

Initially, this is simply an attempt to translate DraqueT's implementation in PolyGlot of the Zompist Vocab Generator, itself a translation from JavaScript, from Java to Python. Longer-term, I want to build a set of tools for managing a conlang via commandline and python with a text-based, flat-file back end for data storage. As much as I like what I can do with PolyGlot, the UI design has meant a lot of swapping back and forth between tabs and I've found it more work than I care to do to when bulk-editing or entering word lists.
